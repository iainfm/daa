         Changed intro sprite to no palette so it's diplayed ok in 256 colour
         modes.

         which is loaded back in when run. Greyed out ² option icon.

         working properly.

         it doesn't 'escape'
17/03/93 1am: Changed so sprite is loaded at himem, rather than in module 
         space, like flex in C.

         'Division by 0' error.

         Put KAR valid strings in writable icons in options window.

         current screen mode.
         ColourTrans used so sprite can be displayed in 256 colour modes.
         Warning added if sprite is not 4bpp.
10/04/93 Started to put a save sprite option on. Got menu entry and drag to
         work so far.

         window.

         ok.(For now). Perhaps add a printer icon to tool box and work menu.

         width of = and - lines to 76 so it's ok on PS printout.

         Linked icon to print routine.
         More messages added.

         and probably compiled/squashed.
25/05/93 RO3 PRMs arrived. Added kerning to start-up text
04/06/93 Used ro3 funtion to read the sizes for the templates.

         is loaded with no palette one is added and 'daa colours' are changed
         in the sprite palette rather than in the pix trans table which didn't
         work in 32K/16M col. modes.

         if the window is being iconised). Check this works ok on ROS3.1x
         'OK' in the title window no longer closes the window.
15/01/95 Re-wrote DEFPROCopen() and shortened considerably. Now no longer
         requires rb%!28=-3 to pin correctly.
16/01/95 Altered open() AGAIN because toolbox wasn't moving correctly when
         toggle size was clicked. Botched it by doing the open bit twice.
